 ***WARNING: THE SYSTEM MATRIX HAS 1 NEGATIVE EIGENVALUES.

     IN AN EIGENVALUE EXTRACTION STEP THE NUMBER OF NEGATIVE EIGENVALUES IS 
     EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF EIGENVALUES BELOW THE CURRENT SHIFT POINT.
     THIS MAY BE USED TO CHECK THAT EIGENVALUES HAVE NOT BEEN MISSED.
     NOTE: THE LANCZOS EIGENSOLVER APPLIES AN INTERNAL SHIFT WHICH WILL
     RESULT IN NEGATIVE EIGENVALUES.

     IN A DIRECT-SOLUTION STEADY-STATE DYNAMIC ANALYSIS, NEGATIVE
     EIGENVALUES ARE EXPECTED. A STATIC ANALYSIS CAN BE USED TO VERIFY THAT THE SYSTEM IS STABLE.

     IN OTHER CASES, NEGATIVE EIGENVALUES MEAN THAT THE SYSTEM MATRIX IS NOT 
     POSITIVE DEFINITE:
     FOR EXAMPLE, A BIFURCATION (BUCKLING) LOAD MAY HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED.

     NEGATIVE EIGENVALUES MAY ALSO OCCUR IF QUADRATIC ELEMENTS ARE
     USED TO DEFINE CONTACT SURFACES.
