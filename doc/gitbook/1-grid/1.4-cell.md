## Cell

A $$D$$-grid can be decomposed in a group of $$D$$-cells called **cell**. Grids and cells are objects of the same topolgy. A cell can bee seen as the smallest possible grid in terms of vertices.

Let a **cell** be an element of the grid. It can be seen as a d-tuple of the form :

A $$D$$-cell is itself a **hyper rectangle** also known as a  [**d-orthotope**](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hyperrectangle).

as the cartesian product of a finite number of such set.
