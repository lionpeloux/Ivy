## Grid
Let $$G = S_1 \times S_2 \times \cdots \times S_{D}$$ be a $$D$$-grid or simply a **grid**, defined as the **cartesian product** of $$D$$ finite and strictly ordered sets :

$$
G = \prod_{j \in [1,D]}  S_j  ~~,~~
S_j = \{s_1^j<s_2^j<~...<s^j_{N_j}\} \in  \mathbb{S}
$$

We denote :

* $$D$$ the number of finite and strictly ordered sets
* $$N_j$$ the cardinality of $$S_j \in \mathbb{S}$$
* $$s_{i}^{j}$$ the $$j^{th}$$ element of the $$i^{th}$$ of $$S_j$$
* $$I_j = [s_1^j,s_{N_j}^j] \in \mathbb{R}$$ the interval in which $$s^j$$ evolves.

> While this grid structure lays out a convenient representation of a $$D$$-dimensional **discrete** parametric space, we introduce for each parameter the continuous interval in which it varies as we are also interested to interpolate the results for any state of inputs.

A $$D$$-grid can be seen as an **hyperrectangle**, also known as a  [**$$D$$-orthotope**](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hyperrectangle). It's a particular kind of convex  [**polytope**](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Polytope) of $$\mathbb{R}^d$$.

>This is a generalization from the easy-to-understand $$\mathbb{R}^1$$, $$\mathbb{R}^2$$ and  $$\mathbb{R}^3$$ cases where :
>
>* a 1-grid is a segments divided into smaller segment called edge
>* a 2-grid is a rectangle divided into smaller rectangles called face
>* a 3-grid is a parallelepiped divided into smaller parallelepipeds called cell
>
>In $$\mathbb{R}^d$$, a **polytope** would indicate a geometric object of dimension $$D$$ whereas a **facet** would account for an object of dimension $$N$$.

One can easily introduce the notion of a **normalized grid**, leading to represent it as a  [**hypercube**](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hypercube) of length 1, which is a **regular polytope**.
